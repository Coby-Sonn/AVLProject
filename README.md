AVL Tree Implementation 🌳

This project implements an AVL tree data structure in Python. The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees for any node is at most one (|node.balance_factor|<=1). This ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

The attached code was built with a fellow student as part of our studies during Tel Aviv University's Data Structures course 🎓

While working on this project, we focused on writing clean, clear, and efficient code, alongside implementing correct and efficient algorithms to ensure the best possible runtime for the multiple methods within the implementation. 🚀💻
